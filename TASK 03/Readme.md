## Fixed Bugs

1. Colors not using the correct format - Added hash symbol for all CSS colors
   - Example fix: `color: 000;` â†’ `color: #000;`

2. Incorrect CSS selector for balls - Fixed the `balls` selector to `#balls` for elements with ID

3. Invalid CSS syntax - Removed quotation marks (``) at the beginning of CSS file that made the syntax invalid

4. Wrong position of decorative elements (balls) - Changed the position of balls from `right: 0px` to `left: 0px` to match the design

5. Missing or not displaying images - Fixed CSS to ensure all images display correctly

6. Suboptimal responsiveness - Added media queries for more responsive display on various screen sizes

## Added Styles

1. Consistent box-sizing - Added `box-sizing: border-box` to ensure more consistent element dimensions

2. Improved hover effects - Fixed hover effects on navigation links and buttons

3. Image size adjustments - Set image sizes to be proportional and responsive

4. Smoother transitions - Added transitions for smoother hover effects

5. Z-index for layering - Used z-index to arrange proper element stacking

## Implemented Best Practices

1. Valid CSS Syntax - Ensuring valid and standard-compliant CSS syntax

2. Separation of Concerns - Maintaining separation between HTML (structure) and CSS (presentation)

3. Color Consistency - Using consistent color formats

4. Responsive Design Principles - Applying responsive design principles for optimal display
